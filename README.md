# Outdoors-for-All-
To  create a proof of concept web application that will improve communication in Outdoor for All’s (OFA) programs by allowing program directors to create private Teams channels for each participant in the program. Each participant’s channel will include a wiki that contains pertinent information about the participant and the channel will act as a space for communication between the guardian of the participant and the volunteer working with the participant. The web application will have intuitive UI to help the program director manage the guardian(s) and volunteer(s) with access to each participant’s channel. Furthermore, the app will provide an option for the program director to choose a custom time slot for the volunteer’s access to the private channel (to prevent communication outside the appropriate hours of the program). Lastly, the program director will be able to make mass communications to the entire program in the General/Announcements channel. This will be done using a web application and utilizing Graph APIs for Microsoft Teams.
